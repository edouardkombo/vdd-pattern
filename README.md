## Welcome to Vocabulary Driven Database Pages

VDD at the difference of Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured databases only starting from a user as "me".

VDD vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model.

Founded by Edouard Kombo, VDD vocabularies are developed by an open community process through GitHub.

A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas.
