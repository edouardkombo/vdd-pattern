## Welcome to Vocabulary Driven Database Pages

VDD is a collaborative community with a mission to create, maintain and promote schemas for structured databases.

VDD vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model.

A shared vocabulary makes it easier for developers and architects to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts.

Founded by Edouard Kombo, VDD vocabularies are developed by an open community process through GitHub, feel free to join the community.


### Understand the VDD pattern

The philosophy behind VDD resides in 4 principles that claim that a user:
- is always a representation of "me"
- is nothing more than a single identifier 
- owns reusable attributes through relations
- can live without attributes but not a single identifier
